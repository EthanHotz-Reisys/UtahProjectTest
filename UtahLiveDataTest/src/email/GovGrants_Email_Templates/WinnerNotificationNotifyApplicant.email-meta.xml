This amount is based on the estimated costs for implementing the proposed program, as well as your demonstration of your organization’s capacity to do so.

The pre-award objective is to obtain an approved scope of work, work plan, budget and spending plan for the project period. Note: Only the applicant organization is eligible to receive a NOGA.
